This <span class="italic">Rule of Life for Associates</span> lays a foundation of Eucharistic
life for lay people associated with the religious Institutes
founded by Saint Peter Julian Eymard: the Congregation
of the Blessed Sacrament and the Servants of the Blessed
Sacrament.
</p><p>
It stems from the long tradition of our religious families,
which, starting from Saint Peter Julian Eymard, gave life
to a public association of lay faithful called the <span class="italic">Aggregation
of the Blessed Sacrament</span> in order to share the Eucharistic
mission with the laity.
</p><p>
The present text expresses a renewed vision of associated
life of lay faithful with our Congregation taking into account
the experiences made over the last years, especially since the
approval of the respective two Eymardian Institutes' <span class="italic">Rule
of Life</span>.
</p><p>
It is offered to all those who feel moved by the Holy Spirit
and understand themselves as belonging to the one spiritual
family which draws inspiration from Saint Peter Julian
Eymard.

Inspired by the spirit
of Saint Peter Julian Eymard,
we form a lay Association, approved by the Church,
called the <span class="italic">Aggregation of the Blessed Sacrament</span>
in partnership with
the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament
and the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament.
</p>
<p>
We thus seek to pursue
our Christian vocation
and our call to holiness
by following the evangelical way
taught by Saint Peter Julian Eymard.

Our Ideal
is to live the mystery of the Eucharist fully
and to make known its meaning,
so that Christ's reign may come
and the glory of God
may be revealed to the world.
</p>
<p>
In response to our baptismal vocation
we seek to witness to Christ's presence
at the crossroads of society and,
starting from the Eucharist,
we strive to influence our world
in the light of this Mystery,

<h4 class="chapter">3 The Founder</h4>
<p>
We are inspired by the teachings
and example of Saint Peter Julian Eymard,
"Outstanding Apostle of the Eucharist."
He responded to the needs
of the people of his time
by proclaiming God's love
manifested in a special way
in Christ's gift in the Eucharist;
he encouraged the faithful to share,
as associated members,
in the charism and the mission
of the religious Congregations he founded.
</p>
<p>
Convinced that a life
cannot be fully Eucharistic
if it is not consecrated to God and to people,
he left us an example
of contemplation and apostolic action.

We associate ourselves to this gift
that he makes of himself,

Kingdom,
making our own the Apostle's words:

<h4 class="chapter">5 The Life of the Associates</h4>
<p>
The Eucharistic lifestyle of Christians
is ecclesial and communal.
</p>
<p>
Following the example of the first
Christian community,
our experience of communion
is nourished by the Word,
by the "breaking of Bread,"
by prayer,
and by listening to the teaching
of the Apostles.
By living with
"one heart and one soul"
we witness to the presence of the Risen Lord.
</p>
<p>
We commit ourselves to being Associates
by sharing in gatherings of prayer and
formation.

It is united to the Congregations of the
Religious and Servants of the Blessed
Sacrament as it's <span class="italic">"own association"</span> since it was
founded by Saint Peter Julian Eymard as a
spiritual affiliation of his Congregations, but
also because it has been officially declared
</p>
<div id="page-27" class="anchor"></div>
<div class="page-number">Page 27</div><hr class="basic" />
<p>
as such by the Holy See for the Religious
(20.12.1858; cf. SC Rei. Decr. 15.10.1957
in "Analecta" V p. 62) and the Servants of
the Blessed Sacrament (Laudatory Brief
2.8.1872).
</p>
<p>
It was erected as a <span class="italic">"Public, universal and
international Association"</span> (can. 312 &sect; 1, 1&#176;),
in fact, it was constituted, almost from its
beginnings, as such by the Holy See (cf. Lit.
Ap. 29.1.1875 and 8.5.1897) and thus enabled
to follow its objectives in the name of the
Church (can. 313). To it from 1 August 1923
were affiliated all lay associations of the
two religious Congregations, thus officially
confirming also the communion that unites
all lay associates of the great Eymardian family
who share the same Eucharistic spirituality
and mission.

<p>
The aggregation, by participating in
the charism of the two Congregations
founded by saint Peter Julian Eymard,
is placed under their overall direction (can.
303).
</p>
<p>
It is organized on an international, national,
and local level.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="italic">overall direction</span> of the Aggregation is
entrusted to the Superiors General of the
two Congregations, its headquarters is at
the respective Generalates: Via Giovanni

The <span class="italic">National Director</span> is the Provincial

<p>
The <span class="italic">local Director</span> of the Aggregation in the
churches and shrines of the Congregation
is by right the Superior of the community,
who can delegate this task to another
religious of the Congregation.
</p>
<p>
For churches or shrines not of the
Congregation, the local Director is named
by the local Ordinary (can. 317 &sect; 2), in
dialogue with the Provincial Superior.
</p>
<p>
Where both religious Congregations are
present, there is a close collaboration between
those responsible and the members of the
aggregation, and common initiatives are
organized regarding formation and mission.

The <span class="italic">local Director</span> has full authority for

or three years) and are re-eligible.

<p>
In dialogue with the Board, the Director will
see to it that the Associates:
</p>
<ul class="director">
<li>be formed in Eucharistic spirituality,</li>
<li>be introduced into prayer according to Saint Peter Julian Eymard's charism,</li>
<li>grow in a life of witness and service inspired by the Eucharist,</li>
<li>deepen their knowledge of the Church's social doctrine</li>
<li>express their lay apostolate in communion with the local church.</li>
</ul>

In dialogue with the Board, the Director
convokes and presides at the meetings, which
are normally held each month.

Gracious God of our ancestors, you led

on a journey of faith. Under the guidance
of your gentle Spirit, Peter Julian discovered

mystery worthily, adore it profoundly, and
proclaim it prophetically for your greater
glory. Amen.

"In your prayer aspire to nourish yourself upon
God... This is the secret of true prayer; to discover
God's action and plans in His love for us! Then
the soul cries out 'How good you are, oh my God!
What can I do for you? What could please you?'
That is the which that rises from the hearth. To
attain such a living prayer, we must forget ourselves,
or avoid seeking ourselves in any way in prayer. We
must simplify the work of our mind by a simple
and calm view of God's truths."
